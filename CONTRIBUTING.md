# Contributing to Pipeflow

Thanks for your interest in improving Pipeflow! We welcome contributions from the community and appreciate your time and effort.

## Ways to help
- **Report issues** – Let us know about bugs, documentation gaps, or feature ideas by opening a GitHub issue with clear reproduction steps or context.
- **Improve documentation** – Clarify existing docs, add tutorials, or share real-world tips that make Pipeflow easier to adopt.
- **Build new stages** – Extend the core catalogue with reusable stages that integrate APIs, SaaS tools, or domain-specific logic.
- **Enhance the core** – Optimise performance, improve developer ergonomics, or fix defects in the pipeline engine itself.

## Getting started
1. Fork the repository and create a topic branch from `main`.
2. Install dependencies via `composer install`.
3. Make your changes, keeping the code style consistent with the existing project.
4. Add or update tests where appropriate and run the full test suite.
5. Update documentation if your change alters behaviour or introduces new capabilities.
6. Submit a pull request that describes the problem and solution, including any relevant screenshots or logs.

## Code review checklist
- Follow PHP best practices and avoid introducing breaking changes without prior discussion.
- Keep commits focused; group unrelated changes into separate pull requests.
- Ensure CI passes and resolve merge conflicts before requesting review.
- Be responsive to reviewer feedback—collaboration makes Pipeflow better for everyone.

Thank you for helping us build a powerful, accessible automation toolkit!
